# User Research & Feedback
Provider Engagement Experiment

✅ Providers found the system intuitive and efficient.

✅ AI-assisted prescription management was well-received for preventing medication errors.

✅ Standardization of care and time-saving features were seen as major benefits.

❌ Limitations: Short testing period, no long-term data collection, provider-only focus.

Patient Engagement Experiment

✅ Smooth scheduling experience, optimized for elderly users.

✅ High patient engagement, exceeding initial expectations.

✅ Accessibility features (text, phone, and email reminders) were highly valued.

❌ Concerns Raised: Provider transparency, and broadband limitations in rural areas.

# LLM Prompt Library
This section outlines the AI-generated prompts used throughout the project to guide development, validate hypotheses, and assist in AI-driven decision support. These prompts were integrated into the prototype workflow to optimize provider efficiency, streamline patient interactions, and ensure regulatory compliance.

# How We Used These Prompts

The AI-generated prompts were utilized in multiple stages of the project:

User Research: Helped define major pain points for geriatric healthcare providers and patients in Kittitas County.

Prototype Development: Enabled the creation of AI-driven appointment scheduling and patient interaction models.

Hypothesis Validation: Assisted in testing how AI could reduce provider workload and improve decision-making efficiency.

AI-Powered Decision Support: Enhanced provider workflows by assisting with treatment planning, medication safety checks, and clinical decision-making.

# LLM Prompts Used in This Project
